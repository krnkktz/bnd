- stack the notifications (keep track of still alive children)
- note daemon pid for stop
- usage, help, --start, --stop
- error log
- think about security (installation? escaping stuff? maybe some sort of
  protection against too many requests? (eg no more than 15 windows at once))
- configure socket placement, log placement, etc.
- find out why there are still zombies
