- change the background color with the command line
- change the text with the command line
- think about whether we need a daemon or not - it would be kind of nice but
  not really useful on the other hand, except if the notifications have to come
  back, but i guess that will be decided after some days of using the program.
- maybe daemon so we can stack the notifications? or is there a ~/.bndtmp (nice!)
  somewhere?
